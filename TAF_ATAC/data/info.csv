Data compile by WGWIDE. Weight-at-age in the stock calculated as the average of the weight-at-age in three areas, corresponding to definition of the former spawning components, weighted by the relative mackerel biomass in each area (as estimated by the 2022 egg survey for the southern and western areas and the 2017 egg survey for the North Sea area). Mean weight-at-age in 2022 for the western area are estimated from Dutch, Irish and German commercial catch data, the biological sampling data taken during the egg surveys and during the Norwegian tagging survey. Only samples corresponding to mature fish, from areas and periods corresponding to spawning, as defined at the 2014 benchmark assessment (ICES, 2014) and laid out in the Stock Annex, were used to compute the mean weight-at-age in the western spawning area. For the North Sea area, mean weight-at-age in 2022 were calculated from samples of the commercial catches collected from Divisions 4.a and 4.b in the second quarter of 2022. Stock weights for the southern area, are based on samples from the Spanish catches and surveys in Divisions 8.c and 9a in the 2nd quarter of the year. The mean weights in the three area and in the stock in 2022 are shown in table 8.5.2.","Sigurvin Bjarnason, MFRI, Iceland","sigurvin.bjarnason@hafogvatn.is","Ecological",FALSE
